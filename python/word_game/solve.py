"""This program is a WordleÂ® solver. Given the results of one or more
Wordle guesses, this program prints a list of words that match the
results.

How to use this program.
1. Run this program
2. Begin playing Wordle.
3. After entering one or more guesses in Wordle, enter the results of
   those guesses in this program.
4. This program will print a list of words that fit the results of your
   guesses.

This program contains a known problem. If the user enters the result of
a guess that contains two of the same letter, this program will include
words that contain only one instance of that letter in its output. For
example:
1. A user plays Wordle and enters the guess "alarm".
2. Wordle responds with the result "ALa.."
3. The user enters "Ala.." (first result) and "mr" (letters not in the
word).
4. This program will respond with these words:
   algae
   alibi
   ...
Notice that "alibi" is in the list but cannot be the secret word because
it doesn't have two a's.
