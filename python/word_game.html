<h1>Play, Solve, and Analyze Wordle</h1>

<p>Near the end of an introductory Python course that I teach at
<a href="https://www.byui.edu">BYU-Idaho</a>, students must write a
program about a topic that they choose. In 2022, I decided that I should
also choose and write a program so that I demonstrated what the students
are required to do. I enjoy playing the word game called
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/">WordleÂ®</a> and chose to
write one or more programs related to it.</p>

<p>* Wordle is a registered trademark of the New York Times Company.</p>

<p>Wordle is a game in which a player has six chances to guess a
five-letter word. After each guess, the game responds with a clue that
tells the player which letters are in the secret word and which are not
and which letters are in the correct position and which are not.</p>

<p>Of course, I enjoyed writing the Python code so much that instead of
writing one program and a test file as my students are required to do, I
wrote four programs and a test file. You can download all of the code in
this
<a download href="word_game.zip"><code>word_game.zip</code> file</a> or
you can download the individual programs from the following list.</p>

<dl class="long">
    <dt><a download href="word_game/play.py"><code>play.py</code></a></dt>
    <dd>A clone of Wordle implemented in Python that allows a user to
    play in a terminal or console window.</dd>

    <dt><a download href="word_game/solve.py"><code>solve.py</code></a></dt>
    <dd>Accepts the clues from a game of Wordle and prints a list of
    words that match the clues.</dd>

    <dt><a download href="word_game/analyze.py"><code>analyze.py</code></a></dt>
    <dd>Analyzes all the words in a list of five-letter words and
    produces groups of four words that have no letters in common. These
    groups of words are useful for playing Wordle because each group
    tests 20 letters in a Wordle game.</dd>

    <dt><a download href="word_game/extract.py"><code>extract.py</code></a></dt>
    <dd>Builds a list of five-letter words by extracting them from a
    text file.</dd>

    <dt><a download href="word_game/test.py"><code>test.py</code></a></dt>
    <dd>A Pytest file that verifies the correctness of the other
    programs.</dd>
</dl>

<p>According to <code>analyze.py</code>, the best group of four words to
begin a Wordle game with are "snare", "block", "fight", and "dumpy".
Notice that none of the words have letters in common with the other
words. By beginning a Wordle game with these four words, you will have
tested 20 letters in four guess. This will make it easy to guess the
word in your remaining two guesses.</p>
