<h1>Data Visualization with Pandas&mdash;a brief introduction</h1>
<p><dfn>Data visualization</dfn> is the graphical representation of data
in charts and graphs to help people visualize and understand data more
easily than they would by looking at tables of numbers. Data
visualization is closely related to and often comes after data analysis.
In other words, a data scientist will often perform data analysis to
process large data sets and then use data visualization techniques to
make charts and graphs from the data.</p>

<p>The <code>pandas</code> module includes functions to draw different
types of charts. In <code>pandas</code>, charts are called plots.
Interestingly, the plots are not actually drawn by <code>pandas</code>
but instead by another Python module named
<code>matplotlib.pyplot</code>.</p>

<p>Drawing a plot with the <code>pandas</code> module can be as simple
as these three steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li><div>read the data</div></li>
    <li><div>define the plot</div></li>
    <li><div>draw (show) the plot</div></li>
</ol>

<p>For example:</p>
<div class="pre" id="ex1">
<pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="code language-python">
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot

# Step 1. Read a DataFrame from a CSV file.
df = pd.read_csv("filename.csv")

# Step 2. From the DataFrame, define a vertical bar plot.
df.plot(kind="bar", x="column_name_1", y="column_name_2")

# Step 3. Draw and show all defined plots.
pyplot.show()</pre>
</div>

<p>In the above example,
<span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">lines&nbsp;2 and&nbsp;11</span> are
easy to forget but without them, the plots that your code defines will
not be shown on the computer’s monitor.</p>

<p><span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">Line&nbsp;8</span> in the example
code above contains a call to the pandas <code>DataFrame.plot</code>
method. The <var>kind</var> named argument tells the
<code>DataFrame.plot</code> method what type of plot to draw. There are
at least nine types of plots that <code>DataFrame.plot</code> can draw
by changing the value for the <var>kind</var> named parameter as
follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li><div><code>area</code> - area plot</div></li>
    <li><div><code>bar</code> - vertical bar plot</div></li>
    <li><div><code>barh</code> - horizontal bar plot</div></li>
    <li><div><code>box</code> - box plot</div></li>
    <li><div><code>density</code> - density plot</div></li>
    <li><div><code>hexbin</code> - hexagonal bin plot</div></li>
    <li><div><code>hist</code> - histogram</div></li>
    <li><div><code>pie</code> - pie plot</div></li>
    <li><div><code>scatter</code> - scatter plot</div></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the <code>kind</code> named argument, the
<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html">plot method</a>
can take many other named arguments including these:</p>

<ul>
    <li><div><code>x</code>: string or list of strings - The column or
    columns to plot along the x-axis.</div></li>
    <li><div><code>y</code>: string or list of strings - The column or
    columns to plot along the y-axis.</div></li>
    <li><div><code>title</code>: string - The title to use for the
    plot.</div></li>
    <li><div><code>xlabel</code>: string - The label for the x-axis.</div></li>
    <li><div><code>ylabel</code>: string - The label for the y-axis.</div></li>
    <li><div><code>color</code>: string - The of the color that the plot
    will be drawn in.</div></li>
    <li><div><code>legend</code>: boolean - True to draw the legend,
    False to hide the legend.</div></li>
</ul>

<p>The <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> named arguments tell the
<code>DataFrame.plot</code> method which columns in the data frame to
use as the x and y axes in the plot. You can cause pandas to draw the
data from multiple columns on the same plot by passing a list of strings
for the <var>y</var> named argument as shown on <span class="cross"
data-ref="ex2">line&nbsp;3</span> in the next code example.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex2">
<pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="code language-python">
# Define a vertical bar plot from the DataFrame.
df.plot(kind="bar", x="column_name_1",
    y=["column_name_2", "column_name_3", "column_name_4"])</pre>
</div>

<p>Writing code to define a plot for a pandas DataFrame is usually
simple. Unfortunately, writing code to define a plot for a pandas Series
can be very confusing. Recall that a pandas DataFrame contains multiple
rows and columns but that a pandas Series contains only a single column.
When we call <code>DataFrame.plot</code>, we can use both the
<var>x</var> and <var>y</var> named arguments to chose the columns for
the x and y axes. However, when we call <code>Series.plot</code>, a
Series has one column only, so we shouldn’t use both the <var>x</var>
and <var>y</var> named arguments, but instead we should use only one of
them. This problem is most often seen when we write code to group and
aggregate a DataFrame which often produces a Series. In that situation,
when we call Series.plot we should use just the <var>y</var> named
argument.</p>

<p>Although drawing a plot can be very simple, a data scientist may have
to write significant amounts of code to analyze and process the data
before defining a plot.</p>

<p>There are many options that you can use in your code to modify the
look and layout of a plot. Some of these options are not available
through the <code>pandas</code> functions but instead are available
through the <code>matplotlib.pyplot</code> functions.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Below are two plots that were drawn by this Python program that uses
<code>pandas</code> and <code>matplotlib.pyplot</code>.</p>

<p>Both plots show the exact same data, first as a pie plot and then as
a vertical bar plot. Although pie plots are very popular, most data
scientists don’t use them because they convey less information than a
bar plot.</p>
