<h1>Comparing Floating-Point Numbers</h1>

<p>Within a computer program, comparing floating-point numbers for
equality is problematic. Writing an <code>if</code> statement to compare
floating-point numbers in the same way we would for integers like the
following Java code will sometimes give unexpected results.</p>

<div class="pre">
<pre class="code language-java">float e = &hellip;
float f = &hellip;

// WRONG! Don't use this comparison code
// for floating-point numbers. It will
// occasionally give incorrect results.
if (e == f) {
    // e and f are equal.
}
else {
    // e and f are not equal.
}
</pre></div>

<p>These unexpected results are technically correct but contrary to the
intent of the programmer. In other words, these unexpected results are
incorrect from the perspective of the programmer and users of a program.
The reason a simple comparison for equality with floating-point numbers
will sometimes give unexpected results is that computers approximate
most real numbers as floating-point numbers. Each time a computer
performs calculations with floating-point numbers, rounding error almost
always occurs. Consider the simple example of adding 0.1 ten times as
shown in this Java code and its output:</p>

<div class="pre">
<pre class="code language-java">final float tenth = 0.1F;
float sum = 0F;
for (int i = 0;  i &lt; 10;  ++i) {
    sum += tenth;
}
System.out.println("sum = " + sum);</pre></div>
<pre class="console">/* Output */
sum = 1.0000001</pre>

<p>Similar code written in C gives a more precise but equally strange
output.</p>

<div class="pre">
<pre class="code language-c">const float tenth = 0.1F;
float sum = 0F;
for (int i = 0;  i &lt; 10;  ++i) {
    sum += tenth;
}
printf("sum = %.15f\n", sum);</pre></div>
<pre class="console">/* Output */
sum = 1.000000014901161</pre>

<p>Of course, neither answer is correct because the correct answer to
0.1 added ten times is obviously 1. Because of the rounding error that
occurs when the computer performs floating-point calculations, we cannot
compare floating-point numbers for equality with the simple equality
operator (==) that we use for integers. We must compare floating-point
numbers in a way that evaluates to true when the numbers are close
enough to be considered equal. One simple way to compare two
floating-point numbers is to compare the absolute difference between the
two numbers like this:</p>

<div class="pre">
<pre class="code language-java">if (Math.abs(e - f) &lt;= epsilon) {
    // e and f are equal.
}
else {
    // e and f are not equal.
}</pre></div>

<p>But how do we choose the value for <var>epsilon</var>? For some
applications, we may know the range of values that will be in
<var>e</var> and <var>f</var> and be able to choose a good value for
<var>epsilon</var>, but for many applications, we know very little about
the range of values that will be in <var>e</var> and <var>f</var>.
Perhaps the value of <var>epsilon</var> could be calculated from the
values of <var>e</var> and <var>f</var>. One possibility is to calculate
<var>epsilon</var> as a percentage of the larger of <var>e</var> and
<var>f</var>. For example:</p>

<div class="pre">
<pre class="code language-java">float max = Math.max(Math.abs(e), Math.abs(f));
float epsilon = max * 0.01;
if (Math.abs(e - f) &lt;= epsilon) {
    // e and f are equal.
}
else {
    // e and f are not equal.
}</pre></div>

<p>The previous Java code will compare two floats <var>e</var> and
<var>f</var> to see if the difference between them is within 1% (0.01)
of the larger float. Of course, the 1% could be changed to be smaller if
we desire. This is a pretty good way to compare floating-point numbers.
However, computer scientists have known for a long time that comparing
floating-point numbers for equality is problematic, so they developed
some concepts and functions to help.</p>

<p>One concept that can help us compare two floating-point numbers is
<dfn>unit in the last place</dfn>, which is often abbreviated as ulp. An
<dfn>ulp</dfn> is the unit of least significance within a floating-point
number. In other words, it is the distance from one positive
floating-point number to the next larger floating-point number. We can
use the concept of ulp to make floating-point comparisons for equality
more exact and robust. Many programming languages that include
floating-point arithmetic include a function to calculate ulps. Java
contains two functions in the <code>Math</code> class for computing
ulps.</p>

<ul>
    <li><div><code>Math.ulp(float f)</code></div></li>
    <li><div><code>Math.ulp(double d)</code></div></li>
</ul>

<p>Here is Java code to compare two floats for equality by checking if
the distance between them is less than or equal to two ulps of the
larger float.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex5">
<pre class="code language-java">float max = Math.max(Math.abs(e), Math.abs(f));
float ulp = Math.ulp(max);
if (Math.abs(e - f) &lt;= ulp * 2) {
    // The distance between e and f is less than or
    // equal to 2 ulps of the larger of e and f, so
    // they are close enough to be considered equal.
}
else {
    // The distance between e and f is larger than
    // than 2 ulps of the larger of e and f, so they
    // are considered unequal.
}</pre></div>

<p>We can use the previous code to write a small function to compare two
floating-point numbers for equality.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex6">
<pre class="code language-java">public static boolean equals(float e, float f, int maxULPs) {
    boolean eq;
    boolean enan = Float.isNaN(e);
    boolean fnan = Float.isNaN(f);
    if (enan &amp;&amp; fnan) {
        // Both e and f are not numbers (NaN),
        // so we consider them to be equal.
        eq = true;
    }
    else if (enan || fnan) {
        // Either e or f but not both is not a
        // number (NaN), so they aren't equal.
        eq = false;
    }
    else {
        boolean einf = Float.isInfinite(e);
        boolean finf = Float.isInfinite(f);
        if (einf &amp;&amp; finf) {
            // Both e and f are infinite, so they
            // are equal if their signs are equal,
            // otherwise they are not equal.
            int esign = (int)Math.signum(e);
            int fsign = (int)Math.signum(f);
            eq = (esign == fsign);
        }
        else if (einf || finf) {
            // Either e or f but not both is
            // infinite, so they aren't equal.
            eq = false;
        }
        else {
            // Both e and f are finite numbers, so
            // compare them to see if they are
            // close enough to be considered equal.
            float max = Math.max(Math.abs(e), Math.abs(f));
            float ulp = Math.ulp(max);
            eq = (Math.abs(e - f) &lt;= ulp * maxULPs);
        }
    }
    return eq;
}</pre></div>

<p>This function may seem complex and may run slowly, but if we use
simpler and naive techniques for comparing floating-point numbers for
equality, then we may have faster code, but it will return incorrect
results for some numbers. What good is fast code if it produces
incorrect results?</p>
