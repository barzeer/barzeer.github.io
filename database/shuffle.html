<h1>Shuffle Column Values</h1>
<p>Recently, I needed to shuffle all the values in one column of a MySQL
table. I implemented the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle">Fisher-Yates shuffle</a>
as described at Wikipedia as a procedure in MySQL. I implemented the
shuffle entirely in place, and it turned out to be much slower than I
thought it would. On my HP laptop, it took more than 47 seconds to
shuffle the values in a single column in a table with 6240 rows.</p>

<p>Here is the shuffle code.</p>

<div class="pre">
<pre class="code lang-sql">-- Shuffles the contents of a column using the Fisher-Yates
-- shuffle algorithm. This is SLOW in MySQL.
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS shuffle;
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE shuffle()
BEGIN
    -- Get the number of rows in the table.
    DECLARE numRows INT DEFAULT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer);

    DECLARE rowI, rowJ, idI, idJ INT;
    DECLARE valueI, valueJ TEXT;

    -- Start at the first row in the table.
    SET rowI = 0;

    WHILE rowI &lt; numRows - 1 DO
        -- Get a random integer in the range [rowI, numRows)
        SET rowJ = rowI + FLOOR(RAND() * (numRows - rowI + 1));

        IF rowI &lt; rowJ THEN
            -- Get the data from the table for rowI.
            SELECT customer_id, address INTO idI, valueI
            FROM customer ORDER BY customer_id LIMIT rowI, 1;

            -- Get the data from the table for rowJ.
            SELECT customer_id, address INTO idJ, valueJ
            FROM customer ORDER BY customer_id LIMIT rowJ, 1;

            -- Put the data from rowI into rowJ
            -- and the data from rowJ into rowI.
            UPDATE customer
            SET address = IF(customer_id = idJ, valueI, valueJ)
            WHERE customer_id = idI OR customer_id = idJ;
        END IF;

        -- Move to the next row.
        SET rowI = rowI + 1;
    END WHILE;
END//
DELIMITER ;</pre>
</div>

<p>I thought the shuffle would be faster because the Fisher-Yates
shuffle algorithm is O(n), and I used the primary key in the <code>ORDER
BY</code> clause in the <code>SELECT</code> queries and in the
<code>WHERE</code> clause in the <code>UPDATE</code> statement, and of
course the table has an index on the primary key. I know that I could
simply use <code>ORDER BY RAND()</code>, but this is simply a random
permutation of the order and not the same as a shuffle.</p>
