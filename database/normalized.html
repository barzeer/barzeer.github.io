<h1>Normalized Database Designs</h1>
<p>Each of the following relational database designs is normalized to at
least third normal form. Each design has at least one interesting
feature that may help you as you design databases.</p>

<h2>Magazine</h2>
<p>This very simple design shows that a linking table can be expanded to
contain more columns than just the foreign keys from the two parent
tables. Notice that the subscription table has relationships with the
magazine and subscriber tables like a linking table would have. However,
the subscription table also includes additional columns.</p>

<h2>Automobile Dealership</h2>
<p>One interesting feature of this simple database design for an
automobile dealership is the purchase table. The purchase table allows a
single automobile to be purchased multiple times which often happens at
a dealership when a customer buys a new automobile and then several
years later trades in that automobile, and the dealership sells the
automobile as a used vehicle to a different customer.</p>

<h2>Business Directory</h2>
<p>The business directory design contains a table with a
self-relationship. Notice in the category table how the
<code>parent_id</code> column is a foreign key that is connected to the
category_id primary key in the same table.</p>
