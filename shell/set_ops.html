<h1>Set Operations Using Shell Script Commands</h1>

<p>On many occasions Iâ€™ve had lists of names or other data stored in
text files. The lists were really sets of names since no name was
duplicated in the list. I often wanted to quickly and easily compute the
intersection, union, relative complement, and symmetric difference of
those sets. Because the sets were stored in text files, it seemed to me
that the easiest way to compute these set operations was from a command
line or shell. So I wrote the following four bash scripts. All the
scripts use existing Unix commands, such as sort, sed, and comm and
therefore assume that the sets are stored in text files with only one
element listed on each line. All four scripts write their output to
stdout.</p>

<p>Beside computing the set operations, each of the scripts provides
an interesting study of the basic shell commands sort, sed, and
comm.</p>

<h3>Intersection</h3>
<div class="pre"><pre class="code lang-bash">#!/bin/bash

# intersect
# Purpose: Compute intersection of sets $1 and $2.
#   A ^ B = {x : x e A and x e B}
#
# Expected format of sets:
# 1. One element per line.
# 2. Blank lines are allowed.
# 3. Comments start with '#' and continue to end of line.
# 4. Leading and trailing white space will be removed.

TMP1=`mktemp --tmpdir --suffix=.txt intse-XXXXX`
TMP2=`mktemp --tmpdir --suffix=.txt intse-XXXXX`

trap "rm -f $TMP1 $TMP2 ; exit 0" EXIT
trap "rm -f $TMP1 $TMP2 ; exit 1" ABRT BUS HUP INT KILL QUIT SEGV

# Remove comments, leading and trailing white space and
# blank lines, and sort input files.
sed -e 's/#.*$//' \
    -e 's/^[[:space:]]*\([^[:space:]]*\)[[:space:]]*$/\1/' \
    -e '/^[[:space:]]*$/d' $1 | \
sort -u &gt; $TMP1
sed -e 's/#.*$//' \
    -e 's/^[[:space:]]*\([^[:space:]]*\)[[:space:]]*$/\1/' \
    -e '/^[[:space:]]*$/d' $2 | \
sort -u &gt; $TMP2

comm -12 $TMP1 $TMP2
exit 0</pre></div>

<h3>Union</h3>
<div class="pre"><pre class="code lang-bash">#!/bin/bash

# union
# Purpose:  Compute the union of sets, i.e. merge sets.
#   A U B = {x : x e A or x e B or x e both}
#
# Expected format of sets:
# 1. One element per line.
# 2. Blank lines are allowed.
# 3. Comments start with '#' and continue to end of line.
# 4. Leading and trailing white space will be removed.

# Remove comments, leading and trailing white space and
# blank lines from the sets and append all sets to $TMP.

# Merge sets using sort with unique flag.

<h3>Relative Complement</h3>
<div class="pre"><pre class="code lang-bash">#!/bin/bash

# relcompl
# Purpose: Compute the complement of set $2 relative to set $1.
# In other words compute set $1 - set $2
#   A \ B = {x : x e A and x ne B}
#
# Expected format of sets:
# 1. One element per line.
# 2. Blank lines are allowed.
# 3. Comments start with '#' and continue to end of line.
# 4. Leading and trailing white space will be removed.

trap "rm -f $TMP1 $TMP2 ; exit 1" ABRT BUS HUP INT KILL QUIT SEGV

# Remove comments, leading and trailing white space and
# blank lines, and sort input files.
sed -e 's/#.*$//' \
    -e 's/^[[:space:]]*\([^[:space:]]*\)[[:space:]]*$/\1/' \
    -e '/^[[:space:]]*$/d' $1 | \
sort -u &gt; $TMP1
sed -e 's/#.*$//' \
    -e 's/^[[:space:]]*\([^[:space:]]*\)[[:space:]]*$/\1/' \
    -e '/^[[:space:]]*$/d' $2 | \
sort -u &gt; $TMP2

comm -23 $TMP1 $TMP2
exit 0</pre></div>

<h3>Symmetric Difference</h3>
<div class="pre"><pre class="code lang-bash">#!/bin/bash

# symdif
# Purpose: Compute the symmetric difference
#   of sets $1 and $2
#   A @ B = {x : x e A or x e B but x ne both}
#
# Expected format of sets:
# 1. One element per line.
# 2. Blank lines are allowed.
# 3. Comments start with '#' and continue to end of line.
# 4. Leading and trailing white space will be removed.

TMP1=`mktemp --tmpdir --suffix=.txt symdif-XXXXX`
TMP2=`mktemp --tmpdir --suffix=.txt symdif-XXXXX`

trap "rm -f $TMP1 $TMP2 ; exit 0" EXIT
trap "rm -f $TMP1 $TMP2 ; exit 1" ABRT BUS HUP INT KILL QUIT SEGV

# Remove comments, leading and trailing white space and
# blank lines, and sort input files.
sed -e 's/#.*$//' \
    -e 's/^[[:space:]]*\([^[:space:]]*\)[[:space:]]*$/\1/' \
