<h1>A Brief Introduction to the Java Programming Language</h1>

<p>Java is a general purpose programming language developed at Sun
Microsystems starting in the early 1990’s. Some programming languages
are developed for a specific purpose, such as typesetting (TeX and
LaTeX), printing (PDF), mathematics (Mathematica), civil engineering
(COGO), and manufacturing (APT). Computer scientists at Sun Microsystems
developed Java to be a general purpose programming language so that a
software developer could use it to solve problems in many computing
disciplines. In 2010, Oracle Corporation aquired Sun Microsytems which
is why you can download Java from Oracle’s website today.</p>

<p>Java was designed to make programming easier and less error prone
than other popular languages, especially C and C++. To make programming
easier and less error prone, Java includes garbage collection, array
index checking, and primitive data types with a defined size and
eliminates unsigned data types. To enable programmers to write a program
once and run it on any computing device, Java was designed to compile to
an intermediate computer language known as bytecode.</p>

<p>To create a running Java program, a software developer does the
following:</p>
<ol>
    <li><div>Writes Java code in a text file. The name of the text file
    must end with ".java"</div></li>

    <li><div>Runs the Java compiler which compiles the Java code to
    bytecode. The bytecode is stored in a file with the same name as the
    Java code except the bytecode filename ends with ".class" instead of
    ".java"</div></li>

    <li><div>Runs the Java virtual machine which executes the bytecode
    on a computer.</div></li>
</ol>

<p>Many software development environments, including Android Studio,
combine steps 2 and 3 into a single step of clicking a run icon.</p>

<p>A software developer must write all Java files to match this
template:</p>

<div class="pre">
<pre class="code language-java">package <var>declaration</var>;

import statements;

class <var>declaration</var> {
    <var>attributes</var>;

    <var>methods</var>;
}</pre>
</div>

<h3>Example</h3>
<div class="pre">
<pre class="code language-java">package edu.byui.cit.appname;

import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;
import java.util.List;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
}</pre>
</div>
