<h1>Excel Spreadsheet with Auto Date Column</h1>
<p>In the past, several people have asked me if there is a way to get
Microsoft Excel to automatically fill in today’s date in a column. These
people have tried entering formula with the <code>=TODAY()</code>
function only to find that it updates the cell to the current date each
time the spreadsheet is opened. What they really want is an easy way to
insert today’s date as a static date value and not a formula, and
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/insert-the-current-date-and-time-in-a-cell-b5663451-10b0-40ab-9e71-6b0ce5768138">Excel contains a keyboard shortcut</a>
to do that. To insert the current date in an Excel spreadsheet, use the
Ctrl-; keyboard shortcut (press and hold the ctrl key and while holding
the ctrl key press and release the semicolon key).</p>

<p>The keyboard shortcut is quick and works well, but is there an easier
way to get Excel to enter a date in a spreadsheet? Is there a way for a
user to enter data in a column and Excel will automatically enter
today’s date in a different column in the same row? There may be some
built-in functionality in Excel that will do that, but I am unaware of
it. So, I wrote a short VBA macro that will fill in a date column.</p>

<p><a download href="auto_date.xlsm">Download this Excel file</a>, open
it in Excel, and <strong>enable macros</strong>. Then you will be able
to enter anything in columns B, C, or D, and Excel will automatically
enter today’s date in column A of the same row.</p>

alt="Screenshot of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet where the current date
is automatically entered into cells in column A."
title="Screenshot of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet where the current date
is automatically entered into cells in column A."></p>

<p>You can view the VBA macro by pressing
<span class="menu">Alt-F11</span> and then double clicking on
<span class="menu">"Sheet1"</span>. I also copied the VBA macro below.
If you want to change the location of the date column, then change the
value of <code>dateCol</code> variable. For example if you want Excel to
automatically enter the current date into column B, then change
<code>dateCol</code> to 2. In other words change
<span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;8</span> of the macro to
be</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="code language-vb">    dateCol = 2</pre></div>

<p>If you want to change the location of cells that cause Excel to enter
a date, then change the value of <code>keyCells</code>. For example, if
you want any data entered into columns C, D, and E, then change
<code>keyCells</code> to "C1:E32765". In other words change
<span class="cross" data-ref="ex1">line&nbsp;13</span> of the macro to
be</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="code language-vb">    Set keyCells = target.Worksheet.Range("C1:E32765")</pre></div>

<p><strong>Warning</strong>: don’t change the <code>dateCol</code> or
the <code>keyCells</code> so that they overlap. For example don’t change
<code>dateCol</code> to 3 and leave <code>keyCells</code> as "B1:D32765"
because 3 means column C and B1:D3275 includes column C. In other words
they overlap. Doing this will probably cause Excel to freeze or
crash.</p>

<div class="pre" id="ex1"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="code language-vb">Option Explicit


Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal target As Range)
    ' dateCol contains the index of the column where
    ' this macro will enter the current date.
    Dim dateCol As Integer
    dateCol = 1

    ' keyCells contains the range of cells that when
    ' they are changed will cause a date to be entered.
    Dim keyCells As Range
    Set keyCells = target.Worksheet.Range("B2:D32765")

    ' section contains the intersection of the keyCells
    ' and target ranges.
    Dim section As Range
    Set section = Application.intersect(keyCells, target)

    If Not section Is Nothing Then
        If WorksheetFunction.CountA(section) &gt; 0 Then
            Application.EnableEvents = False
            InsertDate dateCol, section
            Application.EnableEvents = True
        End If
    End If
End Sub


Private Sub InsertDate(dateCol As Integer, ByRef section As Range)
    Dim startRow, endRow, startCol, endCol As Integer
    Dim row As Integer
    Dim dateCell, otherCells As Range

    startRow = section.row
    endRow = startRow + section.Rows.count - 1
    startCol = section.Column
    endCol = startCol + section.Columns.count - 1

    For row = startRow To endRow
        Set dateCell = Cells(row, dateCol)

        ' If the date cell is empty then check if
        ' the other cells in the row are not empty.
        If dateCell.Value = "" Then
            Set otherCells = Range( _
                    Cells(row, startCol), Cells(row, endCol))

            ' If the date cell is empty and at least one
            ' of the key cells in the same row is not
            ' empty, then enter a date in the date cell.
            If WorksheetFunction.CountA(otherCells) &gt; 0 Then
                dateCell.Value = Date
            End If
        End If
    Next row
End Sub</pre></div>
