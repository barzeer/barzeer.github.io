<h1>Spreadsheet with Auto Date Column</h1>
<p>In the past, several people have asked me if there is a way to get
Microsoft Excel to automatically fill in today’s date in a column.
These people have tried the <code>=TODAY()</code> function only to find
that it updates the date to the current date each time the spreadsheet
is opened. What they really want is a spread sheet that when they enter
data in one column, the sheet will automatically enter today’s
date in a different column. There may be some built-in functionality in
Excel that will do this, but I am unaware of it. So, I wrote a short VBA
macro that will fill in a date column.</p>

<p>After you have <a download href="auto_date.xlsm">downloaded the
Excel file</a>, opened it in Excel, and <b>enabled macros</b>, you will
be able to enter anything in columns B, C, or D, and Excel will
automatically enter today’s date in column A of the same row.</p>

<p>You can view the VBA macro by pressing
<span class="menu">Alt-F11</span> and then double clicking on
<span class="menu">"Sheet1"</span>. I also copied the VBA macro below.
If you want to change the location of the date column, then change the
value of <code>dateCol</code> variable. For example if you want Excel to
automatically enter the current date into column B, then change
<code>dateCol</code> to 2. In other words change line 11 of the macro to
be</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="code lang-vb">    dateCol = 2</pre></div>

<p>If you want to change the location of cells that cause Excel to enter
a date, then change the value of <code>keyCells</code>. For example, if
you want any data entered into columns C, D, and E, then change
<code>keyCells</code> to "C1:E32765". In other words change line 5 of
the macro to be</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="code lang-vb">    Set keyCells = Range("C1:E32765")</pre></div>

<p><strong>Warning</strong>: don’t change the <code>dateCol</code> or
the <code>keyCells</code> so that they overlap. For example dont’t
change <code>dateCol</code> to 3 and leave <code>keyCells</code> as
"B1:D32765" because 3 means column C and B1:D3275 includes column C. In
other words they overlap. Doing this will probably cause Excel to freeze
or crash.</p>

<div class="pre"><pre class="linenums"></pre>
<pre class="code lang-vb">Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal target As Range)
    ' keyCells contains the range of cells that when
    ' they are changed will cause a date to be entered.
    Dim keyCells As Range
    Set keyCells = Range("B2:D32765")

    If Not (Application.Intersect(keyCells, target) Is Nothing) Then
        ' dateCol contains the index of the column
        ' where the date should be entered.
        Dim dateCol As Integer
        dateCol = 1

        Dim startRow, endRow, startCol, endCol As Integer
        Dim row, col As Integer
        Dim dateCell, currCell As Range

        startRow = target.row
        endRow = startRow + target.Rows.Count - 1
        startCol = target.Column
        endCol = startCol + target.Columns.Count - 1
        For row = startRow To endRow
            Set dateCell = Cells(row, dateCol)

            ' If the date cell is empty then check to
            ' see if other cells in the row have data.
            If dateCell.Value = "" Then
                For col = startCol To endCol
                    Set currCell = Cells(row, col)

                    ' If the date cell is empty and at least
                    ' one of the cells in the same row has
                    ' data, then enter a date in the date cell.
                    If currCell.Value &lt;&gt; "" Then
                        dateCell.Value = Now()
                        Exit For
                    End If
                Next col
            End If
        Next row
    End If
End Sub</pre>
