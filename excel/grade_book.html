<h1>Grade Book Template</h1>
<p>Keeping track of student scores and grades shouldn&rsquo;t be a
difficult, time consuming exercise as it is with several e-learning
software systems. Teachers should spend the majority of their time
preparing and teaching instead of wrestling with difficult grading
systems. Using Microsoft&reg; Excel&reg; we created a simple and
flexible grade book template, shown below, that includes</p>

<ul>
    <li><div>weighted assignments and exams</div></li>
    <li><div>alternating row colors making the score table easier to
    read</div></li>
    <li><div>letter grades automatically assigned from a table that you
    can change</div></li>
    <li><div>accurate midterm and final grades</div></li>
    <li><div>simple statistical measures</div></li>
    <li><div>several easy to read distribution charts</div></li>
    <li><div>all the power and ease of use of Excel at your finger
    tips</div></li>
</ul>

<h2>Excel Features Used</h2>
<p>Intermediate and advanced users of Excel may find this grade book
template interesting because it uses the following Excel features.</p>

<ul>
    <li><div>Conditional formatting rule with a formula that uses the
    ROW and MOD functions to produce highlights on every third row which
    is easier to read than every other row</div></li>
    <li><div>Named ranges to make common references easier to read,
    understand, and maintain and to be used in macros</div></li>
    <li><div>Reference intersect operator (space character) instead of
    the range operator (colon : character) in cells D32:X32 to make the
    references easier to read, understand, and maintain</div></li>
    <li><div>IF and COUNT functions in cells D32:X32 to automatically
    include an assignment in the overall grade calculations only when at
    least one score for that assignment is entered and to exclude that
    assignment otherwise</div></li>
    <li><div>VLOOKUP in cells AE4:AE28 to automatically assign a letter
    grade based on a student&rsquo;s overall score</div></li>
    <li><div>Array formulas (sometimes called Control+Shift+Enter
    formulas or CSE formulas) in cells AA40:AC49 to count how many
    scores fall within each range</div></li>
    <li><div>COUNTIF in cells AF40:AF51 to count how many students have
    earned each letter grade</div></li>
    <li><div>Nice examples of XY scatter and column charts</div></li>
</ul>
